This is just a small (SPA) to introduce myself to Angular programming.

You will need to have: 
Angular CLI: 17.2.1
Node: 20.11.1
Package Manager: npm 10.2.4.

In order to get this project running locally you will need run npm install json-server and run the command "json-server --watch db.json" in terminal. 

In a seperate terminal window run the command "ng serve" to get the live server running. Open the local link that prints to terminal to see the application in browser.

The detail forms don't save data anywhere but it does print out in console when viewed with dev tools.
